### About Myself

I am an aspiring software engineer with a background in analytics and strategy. I enjoy solving complex problems and love the logic process of breaking down the problems into manageable pieces and planning steps to tackle them. I would like to make an impact by building great software products.

I got into software engineering by my previous consulting work and my desire to make greater impact. During my previous consulting experience, I practiced my problem-solving skills by helping pharmaceutical clients to craft launch strategy, measure performance and build commercial operation infrastructure. In the meantime, I realize the value of a great product and see how disruptive the technology can be to impact the world. Hence, I would like to make an impact by being a software engineer to build great tech/products.
